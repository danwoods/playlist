Playlist.js
===========

A node.js based audio server/client

To Run
======
````shell
$> node ./playlist [target_directory]
````
where [target_directory] is the directory of the audio files. If no [target_directory] specified, the current directory is used. Note that currently there must be an .ogg and .mp3 version of each audio file.

Motivation
==========
Mainly to play with node and html5 :) I'm also trying to use as few libraries as possible on the client side, to keep the code as lean and fast as possible.
